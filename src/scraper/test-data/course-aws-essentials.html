IAM can manage users, security credentials (such as API access keys), and allow users to access AWS resources. In this lab, we will be walking through the foundations of IAM. We'll focus on user and group management, and how to assign access to specific resources using IAM managed policies. We'll learn how to find the login URL where AWS users can log in to account, and explore this from a real-world use case perspective.\n\n","category":{"id":1,"name":"AWS","slug":"amazon-web-services","order":"3","type":"module","topic":"AWS","sort":"difficulty","title":"AWS Courses","subtitle":"In-depth AWS training.","show_related":"1","exclude":"community","icon_light":"\/templates\/default\/img\/service\/category\/white\/aws.svg","icon_dark":"\/templates\/default\/img\/service\/category\/amazon.svg","icon_teal":"\/templates\/default\/img\/service\/category\/teal\/aws.svg","icon_red":"\/templates\/default\/assets\/img\/aws_icon_red.png","color":"1bb398"},"banner_image":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/ca_rails\/production\/labs\/banner-e907e3ec-1021-4208-8bb4-04ddfd99280d.png?1579637516","badge_image":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/ca_rails\/production\/labs\/badge-e907e3ec-1021-4208-8bb4-04ddfd99280d.png?1579637516","duration":"1800","published":"1","identifier":"e907e3ec-1021-4208-8bb4-04ddfd99280d","type":{"id":10,"name":"Hands-On Lab","slug":"hands-on-lab","icon":"fa-flask","icon_type":"0"}},{"id":106690242,"remote_id":"ada49154-6c36-4f25-9187-fd4023ad76a1","name":"QUIZ: AWS IAM Essentials","difficulty":"Beginner","description":"Answer the following quiz questions to check your understanding of the topics presented in the lesson related to AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) and how users, group and roles are managed on AWS.","category":{"id":2,"name":"Linux","slug":"linux","order":"6","type":"module","topic":"LiNUX","sort":"difficulty","title":"Linux Courses","subtitle":"In-depth Linux training.","show_related":"1","exclude":"community","icon_light":"\/templates\/default\/img\/service\/category\/white\/linux.svg","icon_dark":"\/templates\/default\/img\/service\/category\/linux.svg","icon_teal":"\/templates\/default\/img\/service\/category\/teal\/linux.svg","icon_red":"\/templates\/default\/assets\/img\/linux_icon_red.png","color":"2e2e2e"},"banner_image":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/ca_rails\/production\/challenges\/banner-ada49154-6c36-4f25-9187-fd4023ad76a1.png","badge_image":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/ca_rails\/production\/challenges\/badge-ada49154-6c36-4f25-9187-fd4023ad76a1.png","duration":"900","challenge_type":"Practice Exam","question_count":"5","published":"1","identifier":"ada49154-6c36-4f25-9187-fd4023ad76a1","type":{"id":6,"name":"Live Environment Challenge","slug":"live-environment-challenge","icon":"landscape","icon_type":"1"}},{"lesson_id":9829,"lesson_name":"Overview of Network Services","seo_name":"overview-of-network-services","text":"<p>In this section we are going to discuss AWS services.

I have worked as  IT instructor for 9 years and I love teaching because knowledge is power and it brings me joy to help people improve their lives through learning.  I currently have multiple industry certifications including the three AWS Associate certifications, NetApp NCDA, Cisco CCNA Route and Switch, CCNA DataCenter and Cisco UCS.  In my spare time, I love to play retro video games, watch movies and hang out with my family.  I am also a bit of a sci-fi geek.</span>

			<p>AWS Essentials is a course for those who are completely new to AWS. No prior AWS experience is required. We will introduce you to AWS, provide an overview of the core AWS services, and walk you through the process of setting up your own AWS account. Your learning will be reinforced with real-world scenarios and hands-on activities using our live environment. And quizzes will help check your understanding of the presented topics.</p>
